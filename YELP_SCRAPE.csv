The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Henry L.,"Came here on a Sunday night with a few friends. It's was around 8pm.
Place was pretty slow with a couple other patrons. Server was welcoming and pretty cool. We had a table by the window. There was a lot of space.
I had a cocktail called Rob Roy. It was average.
Appetizer was crab cakes. It was surprisingly a lot. Came with 2 patties the size of a bk whopper.
Entree was was seared ahi tuna. It was decent. Tuna tasted fresh. Visually, it looked pretty light. But it got me pretty full. Maybe because the crab cakes were so huge. Overall, I can't give too many points for vibes, since it was a Sunday night. Flavors for pretty average, but quality of ingredients keep it above average. I'd say if you're looking for a chill place to have a conversation, this is a good place. If you're a flavor hunter, it's pretty average."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mike S.,"Food was good, beers were cold service was a bit slow but it all worked out. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, fair food portions. Good place to chill."

The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Leslie W.,The Brick recently changed their menu again. I miss the Cajun chicken sandwich. I only eat white meat and was glad to have this on the menu. The have since removed it. I asked the server if I could have the chicken sandwich from the old menu and he said yes. WHoooHOOOO. Unfortunately when it came out it is not the same sandwich. It is sliced chicken on a bun. This does not make a good sandwich. The pieces kept falling out of the bread. It was a horrible way to eat. The original was the reason I came to the brick repeatedly. Since that sandwich is gone I don't find anything comparable on the menu. Guess I will have to find another Cajun chicken somewhere else.
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Stephen G.,"Our second visit to the Brick Pub. First visit a few months back was not bad.
It took at least 15 minutes for the waiter to come to our table. We ordered drinks and dinner. It took around another 10 minutes for the waiter to bring the drinks over. She was doubling as a bartender too. It took around 40 more minutes to get our food...that's almost an hour since we got there. Not acceptable. Fish from fish and chips was over fried and hard. My wife's flank steak order was sirloin tip according to her, and it was pink on the inside though she ordered it medium well.
All in all, we were pretty disappointed..."

The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Senor C.,"This place was SO good. The owner is really cool and the music is always fun.
With that said...
I have now had three bad meals in a row and I am ready to stop trying. That is big bucks I will never get back. How do you screw up a BLT? The bacon was so overcooked that it was more like burnt bacon dust than meat. The ""Philly cheese steak"" was not good and didn't even come with the advertised aioli sauce. My fries sucked and were cold. How on Earth can you make a bad cheese steak? I don't even remember what they screwed up before that but I still remember the dissapointment coupled with a 70 dollar check.
I have had everything on the menu in the past and it ALL used to be good.
Now, I am afraid to order anything.
I sure hope they fix it back to the way it was. There is nothing like this place in the highlands."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Rich L.,"Just wanted to thank the blonde haired girl and bearded guy working tonight for showing racism. We walked in approx 30 mins ago and sat down at the table next to the bar. No acknowledgement even though both of them looked straight at us. Blonde girl started cleaning one of the machines and the bearded guy just kept talking to his friends. We sat the table for 15 mins and neither of them brought a menu or said Hi to us. After I began staring at the girl wondering why we were being ignored, a white couple came in and sat at the bar. Within 30 seconds he had poured them waters and took their order. He made their drinks and we had yet to be greeted or brought a drink menu. Every person in the bar was white including the couple that came in. Coincidence??? Thank you for ruining our evening and reaffirming that asian people are not welcome at the pub."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Andrea I.,"We found this gem on Yelp, and another fantastic find it was. It has local beer on tap that my husband really liked and I had a ""Fru-Fru"" drink the Lavender Mule which was amazing. As if the great drinks weren't enough the food was just as amazing. Ordered the Pastrami Melt and it was some of the best tasting pastrami I have had.
The waitress was very informative and helpful, she knew her products and had answers to all our our questions.

The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mavis E.,Stopped in on a Sunday night coming home from SeaTac. Our GPS actually took us to the wrong bar but we kept looking because we knew it was by a gas station. Comfortable atmosphere and very welcoming. I had the Black and Blue salad it was great with lots of blue cheese dressing. My husband had the chicken sandwich he said it was really good and tasted home made. He loved the dip for the fries. We had two great dark beers on tap. Our waitress was the best. Definitely coming back next trip to SeaTac.
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Brian R.,"I came to this place several times because I loved the atmosphere. But tonight I realize that the owner is completely disconnected from his or her customer base. The heat was off, it was one cook and one bartender. And they spent the entire evening apologizing. The food was incredible and the bartender was great but please help me understand how you put kosher salt in the salt shaker and expect it to come out. This may seem trivial. But cmon Micah!!!! You place one bartender and your amazing cook between you and your customer base. Grow a pair.... I won't be back ... I'm headed towards Gators in Kent ... by by baby"

The server forgot a couple things and ended up comping several food items/drinks. I also notice two other tables get up and leave because the service was slow. I'm not sure if it was the server himself or if they were under staffed for the evening but it got irritating towards the end.
The food was average, pretty typical of a restaurant like this."

I sat down at the bar for about 20 minutes and watched the bartender ignore me, after finally making eye contact and asking for menu the bartender put his hand up and said "" I don't talk to people who are on the phone"" I have never in my life been greeted by anyone in the service industry that was so rude and disrespectful, there are other ways he could relay that message to ask people to get off the phone if that is a company rule. I just got up and walked it the door to never come back service is horrible only reason there is 1 star is because you have no zero option"

The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Clayton J.,"Something about this place was stuffy and snobby. A Bar/Pub that takes reservations, in Renton? I get you, you spent some money to upgrade this place, but don't forget the economic make up of your zip code.
The pictures of the food looked amazing and we were looking for a late night snack. The site said Happy hour from 9-close. Knowing we would not be there until 10:30 we wisely decided to call to make sure food was still being served. The call went to voicemail requesting you make a reservation. It was a weekday night, so how busy could they be. When we got there it was dead. The bartender asked what we wanted and we asked if food was being served. She said food service stopped at 10. Rather than tell her, the website should state this, or inform her that we called before the 15 minute drive only to get voicemail, I figured I would just leave a review of how tacky and avoidable the whole situation was.
There is no excuse to not have a fully informed online menu or website that advises food service hours. But this was the first time I ever called a food establishment and got voicemail. You can't market yourself as upscale, then provide the worst possible experience/service.
Too many places to choose from, even in odd hours and this place will remain on my dismissed list until they can learn to respect the time, effort and intentions of potential customers."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Jason H.,"Tons of local beers on tap, great priced food and great tasting food. Sometimes service can be a little slow during peak rush hours but not bad at all. I'm honestly surprised this place isn't busier all the time for how much we enjoy this place."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Jialin L.,"The worst and slowest service I have ever seen....
1. The server never came to my desk until I went to find him, both for order and check. He was always facing to the computer or playing with cups and bottles at the bar desk.
2. I have been waiting for more than 40 mins after ordering. During my waiting, I have checked with him twice. Given there were only 3 groups of people then, I think this is too slow.
3. After I finished my meal, I told him I wanna check. After that, it takes 25 mins for checking...."

DO NOT EAT THE CHICKEN WINGS
I come to this place every other week and have never had any issues. But last night I decided to order the chicken wings. I wish yelp let me post the picture of these wings. If you are curious, go to google reviews and there is a picture there. The wings were bloody! I showed the waitress and she said that was normal but she would get me another order if I wanted. Ew, if this is normal why would I want more of them? And I was charged for them too."

Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Martyn L.,"Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try."

My potatoes got rang up wrong, but no problem! Dan took care of it, and the staff brought it out courteously. Crunchy, crispy, and delicious flavors. They also had my favorite brews on tap: 2 from holy mountain, and 1 each from cloudburst and stoup.

Maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing, but this place is really just okay. Maybe top 40 sandwich places in Seattle. Definitely outside the top 10 in Ballard alone.
Today I also ordered the ""Mean Salad"" ($5.00). Picture the little side salad you get with you teriyaki order. Meh."

Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Andy T.,"I couldn't help but order their steak tartare club sando every time I went in. My favorite sandwich in all of Seattle. Then my friend ordered the namesake Mean Sandwich. It's the most beautiful sandwich I've ever seen. Layers of bright rouge corned beef, purple pickled cabbage, yellow seeded mustard and green mint. Mint! Not a combo I could have dreamed up but have dreamt of often since. Good and good looking.
And now, they've added, and I can't stress this enough, a burger, which is of the caliber that I've come to expect for my sandwich needs. Get a mean sandwich before you don't."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Sara F.,Ohmigoodness. Such deliciousness. These are some amazing sandwiches. I had the mean sandwhich and my mind was blown and my partner enjoyed the oyster po'boy. The servings were generous. Will be back.
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Scott S.,"The Mean Sandwich is one seriously good sandwich, but I can't stop thinking about the Skins and Ins. They are the best thing to ever happen to a potato. This might be the best food I've had in Seattle. The owners take great pride in their food, and it comes through in the flavor."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Merrick N.,"I'm a fan. The sandwiches are simple but delicious. I've had the chicken cutlet sandwich twice and the bread is to die for. Italian sub was also delish. I wish there were more options, but everything I've tried is really good."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Annie J.,"The potatoes were good and crisp. The fried chicken sammie was reheated from some previous batch making the chicken kind of rubbery. The breading fell off completely. The Mean Sandwich was dry - older batch of corned beef. The pickled cabbage and mint were fresh.
Music was LOUD and the server either had bad allergies or a cold - 8 multiple sneezes into the crook of the arm while holding food. Eek! I'm thinking this place is better during the work week instead of a Saturday. All the rave reviews and stars mean something - but the weekend just ain't the gig. The prices are high $12-15 a sandwich which might be the going rate - happy to pay that but our food was more ""day old donut."" The slasher movies on (it is October) were a bit much but I'm older and it isn't my bag. I'll try again during a work week.
$52 for two mediocre sandwiches, two local beers (one draft, one can) the potatoes and a 10% tip."

Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Heather J.,"My husband and I stopped in today for a bite to eat after venturing into the city on some business (We're new to the area and live in Bellevue) and found this place nearby. The two owner/brothers were there, it was not busy as they told us Monday is usually their slow day. Nicest guys I have ever met. I had the Jersey Sub, it was delicious! Just the right amount of oil/vinegar. The bread was divine and the meats were tasty! I am a sucker for a good Italian sub. My husband had the Mean Sandwich and it was also delicious, though he only let me have one bite. The loaded skins and ins were a delightful treat as were the salt and pepper ones.
Both brothers chatted with us and were very friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back to try some more of their delicious food."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Katy H.,"Ermagerd. I have walked by, driven by, cycled by, staggered by (darn brewery crawls!) this place and never stopped in. Until today. I would be filled with regret, but instead my belly is full of Mean Sandwich!!! Sooo tasty! And unique! Instead of a buttery gut bomb, I enjoyed slightly crisped but super tender thick slices of corned beef with a light and flavorful slaw and surprising and refreshing mint leaves on a fresh, delicious macrina bun. (The actual menu item Mean Sandwich.)Then, because my partner knows better than to keep new food from me, I ""tasted"" his Jersey sub. (And by ""tasted"", I mean I ate about a quarter of it! Oops!) Wow. I'm a philly girl and it's rare to find a well-prepared hoagie with excellent deli meats that are stored and sliced properly. (If you know what a hoagie is, you know what I mean.) The Jersey Sub was delicious: excellent balance of meat, cheese and bread with the perfect amount of lettuce, oil and vinegar. The fries will be a crap shoot: I loved the deep fried chunks of potatoes, but you might be more into stringy fries and that's just personal preference. Everything was well-prepared and the staff was friendly and helpful. Fab beer selection a bonus. Check this place out and get yourself a mean sandwich!!!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,C P.,Hands down the best food in Ballard. Anything on the menu is amazing no matter what you order. Don't bother ordering food anywhere else just come here and eat or get it to go. And they have beer that's on tap thats better than any the brewery's around here. Just amazing!
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Demetrius J.,Amazing food. Owner is very attentive to all customers as well as the staff. Would recommend the Buon Apetito crispy chicken sandwich. Wide range of beer as well as taps. Wish they were open later. Back patio is amazing during summer time. Free Cornhole and Ping Pong. Weekly visits are necessary

Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Martyn L.,"Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try."

Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,J B.,"Are you in the mood for a really exceptional sandwich experience? Then I highly recommend Mean Sandwich and do get The Mean and an order of fries. The burger is really good. I'm looking forward to trying the other items on the menu and I'm thinking they'll be pretty good. Staff is very friendly (parking can be a bit tough, but there is street parking)."

Dan, the owner, was also super friendly and helpful.
Go here soon!"

Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Nicholas E.,"I've had every sandwich on the menu and they're all delicious. The falafel sandwich (midnight at the oasis) is especially excellent, but there's not a weak spot on the menu. Skins & ins are delicious too (they're meant to be crispy on the outside and aren't 'over cooked' as some reviewers claim). Mean Sandwich is a total gem."

""BUNK"" pricey too $15 would've enjoyed a $12 from in bien way more....if you seen the movie spinal tap you'll know what I mean when I say ""shit sandwich"""

Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Julia S.,"Mixed emotions about this place. Came in on Saturday with my daughter. The music was rather loud but figured that's their shtick. What I didn't appreciate was the constant F-bombs being dropped in the rap song and the absolute lack of of acknowledgement that a young person was hearing it all.
With regards to food, I ordered the loaded potatoes, the seasonal bean and corn salad, and a kid's grilled cheese. The potatoes where pretty delicious - crispy potato skins with buffalo sauce, creamy cheese sauce and green onions. The corn and black bean salad was good but would have been improved with the addition of a little avocado. The kids grilled cheese was funky. Not sure what cheese they use but for kiddos best bet is to stick with American or cheddar."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Niels H.,"After moving to Ballard I got to try Mean sandwich for the first time and I can say it is the best sandwich shop I've ever had the privilege of eating at. The food itself is superb. But the real tho g that makes Mean sandwich stand out is the people. It was the best service I've ever had. Exceptional!
-Niels"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,M W.,"I've driven by this place a bunch of times and finally decided to pop in and try it. It's definitely pricey, but the sandwiches sounded interesting. Got the mean sandwich and an order of loaded potato skins.
First off, velveeta in the potato skins. Gross. And they're rock hard.
The Mean Sandwich (presumably the signature item) is mean, but in the sense of being a sick joke to play on someone. That thing is a mess. Why?
- The ""meat"" is almost 100% fat.
- it's slathered in nasty yellow mustard
- the slaw is very soggy
- the mint is terrible with that disgusting mustard.
The bun wasn't bad but it was a bit much. I actually gagged on the last bite of the sandwich, which I never do. Just... gross. Avoid."
